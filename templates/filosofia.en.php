                    "We need new forms of expression. We need new forms, and if we can't have them we had better have nothing."
                    Therefore: may the curtains open to this new quest! How will the theatre of the future be? Will it still be called "theatre"? Or will it be a new genre, capable of merging writing, music, dance, figurative arts, cinema, but also science, technology, physical, augmented and virtual realities?<br />

                    New technologies, particularly the Web, are often used as a marketing resource to promote personal activities, but rarely they serve as a medium for artistic creation.<br />
                    Scenography and 3D virtual theatrical architectures, live streaming public in front of the actor and capable of influencing him with its presence and its reactions, crowdsourcing, Wiki technology and 2.0 Web applied to the writing process and to direction, seriality applied to the theatrical narration… All these are only few of the methods, which we could use in search for innovative forms of a renewed level of interaction between the actor and the public.

                        We believe that the new opera reality shouldn’t only go through a renovation of its form, but also of its repertory. This is why each project we make or host will be categorically original and specifically thought-out for this genre, something still to explore.

                        Not necessarily. Undoubtedly these new operas will reflect and analyse modern and contemporary society, with a particular eye on consequences that technological progress has on all of us. Having said that, even a revisited classical piece is welcomed to our project. What matters is that the subject or the means through which is narrated reflect the connection between the contemporary man and new technologies.
