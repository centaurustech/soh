                <h1>CROWDFUNDING</h1>
                <article>
                    <p class="justify">
                        The Social Opera House and The Streaming Theatre are twin theatres which mission is to promote various projects, those capable of merging theatre or other ancient arts with new Information Technologies and the Web.
                        Wishful to maintain a free usage for both artists and viewers, The Social Opera House and The Streaming Theatre decided to base their fundraising on crowdfunding, thanks to the PDB Network platform by Produzioni dal Basso, published on our websites (hosted in embedding).
                    </p>
                    <h1>A Community of Artists</h1>
                    <p class="justify">
                        The Social Opera House, together with its twin theatre, The Streaming Theatre, is a productions container for innovative artists from all over the world. Anyone can submit his/her project, whatever genre it may be (provided that it should be original and never performed before).<br />
                        Our staff of Art Directors will act as moderator to verify whether the project is in line with our artistic research to ensure a constant high quality season.

                <h1>Why Crowdfunding for Theatre</h1>
                <p class="justify">
                    Once approved, the project can access to the fundraising through our crowdfunding platform. This way not only the artist will be able to obtain the necessary funds to make his/her own opera, but also each viewer will feel responsible to give a contribution through a free donation.
                    This means that anyone could access the operas programme freely, but this also implies that, if one gets passionate enough about one of them, he/she will surely make his/her offer, ensuring that the opera will be completed.
                    Additionally, crowdfunding is the perfect why to maintain that kind of proactivity that the theatrical audience naturally has: in fact, through its funding, the public itself, and not our staff of Art Directors, will establish what opera should be inserted in the season of our theatre and thus choose what to see. And this will contribute to make our theatre a free and democratic space!

                <h1>A Worldwide Showcase</h1>
                <p class="justify">
                    Due to its sole online existence, The Social Opera House and The Streaming Theatre are always accessible theatres: in any place, at any time, from whoever wants to (may they be professionals in the theatrical or artistic field or simply enthusiastic public).
                    For this reason they represent the best manner to give worldwide visibility to an idea, without local limit. They will also embody an off-voice, independent and alternative in comparison to big production houses or to great repertory theatres or festivals: they will be the perfect instrument to be updated on what is new in the field of opera and theatre, or more generally in the artistic world.
